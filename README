Dotfile repository used to store all configuration files.

The configuration files read by tools are symbolic link pointing to those
files. If the links do not exist yet, they can be automatically created with
dotfiles_bootstrap.py located in my bin.git repository
git clone https://github.com/nicovince/bin.git

The files linked are actually hardcoded in the python script.
TODO: create configuration file which read the files that needs to be linked
